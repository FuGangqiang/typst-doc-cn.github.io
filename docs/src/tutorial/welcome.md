## 何时使用 Typst { #when-typst }
Before we get started, let's check what Typst is and when to use it. Typst is a
markup language for typesetting documents. It is designed to be easy to learn,
fast, and versatile. Typst takes text files with markup in them and outputs
PDFs.

Typst is a good choice for writing any long form text such as essays, articles,
scientific papers, books, reports, and homework assignments. Moreover, Typst is
a great fit for any documents containing mathematical notation, such as papers
in the math, physics, and engineering fields. Finally, due to its strong styling
and automation features, it is an excellent choice for any set of documents that
share a common style, such as a book series.
